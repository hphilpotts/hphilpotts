## 👋     **Hi, I’m @hphilpotts**      
...officially a Henry but I'm usually known as Harry.   

## 👷‍ Current side-project:        
- MERN stack linked apps: [React front-end](https://github.com/hphilpotts/veg-app-frontend) and [back-end API](https://github.com/hphilpotts/veg-app-backend) to track eating your 5-a-day (or 10!). The backend is set up and working, recently I have been experimenting with Jest testing. The front end is currently under construction!        

## 👉 About:
- 👀 **I’m interested in** JavaScript first and foremost, especially as part of MERN stack web apps, but I also love working in Python. I'm just as comfortable working on the front-end as on the back-end and happiest when I get to do a bit of both. I'm also learning TypeScript and am finding the differences with JS fascinating!         

- 🕵️‍ I'm currently searching for my first job in software development after completing an intensive bootcamp in late 2022.                

- 🌱 **I’ve recently been learning** TypeScript and Jest testing. I've recently finished reading [this fantastic book on algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) and have recently been reading _Clean Code_ by Robert Cecil Martin. It has been a real eye opener and has immediately changed my approach! I have also started [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) in order to broaden my knowledge of Computer Science and low-level programming.                     

- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on** anything JS, React especially. Also any interesting Python/Django as I need an excuse to revisit them!    

- 🍺 **If I'm not coding** (or working...bills to pay) I'll probably be cooking, cycling or at the pub. I'd like to say reading or running too but these happen less often. Previously the list would include gaming but I'm on a self-imposed hiatus until I get that first job (or until Hades 2 is released)!        

## 👨‍💻 Other projects:        
- TypeScript 'old school' calculator miniproject - initially built using simple HTML & CSS and vanilla JS, later converted to TS. Designed to be quick to build and deploy, this project was really helpful for maintaining my frontend skills whilst also job-seeking and working full-time. Project repo [here](https://github.com/hphilpotts/miniproject-static-calculator) and deployment [here](https://hphilpotts.github.io/miniproject-static-calculator/)!    

- Portfolio site - the second iteration of my personal portfolio site, content is delivered via a single html file using a combination of CSS, vanilla JS and jQuery. [Link to repo](https://github.com/hphilpotts/hphilpotts.github.io), site [deployed here](https://hphilpotts.github.io/) via GitHub Pages.          

- 'Pokégotchi' linked MERN stack apps - built as a team of 3 as part of the General Assembly London Software Engineering Immersive course. Although this project was not completed within the 1 week timeframe set, it presented a huge amount of learning opportunities and was great fun to help build. [Frontend repo](https://github.com/hphilpotts/Pokegotchi-Frontend-Project-4-General-Assembly-SEI-66) and [backend repo](https://github.com/hphilpotts/Pokegotchi-Backend-Project-4-General-Assembly-SEI-66) with full README detailing my contributions in Google Doc format [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t7EvTLFPsIKQwhfXQDHanu9GjoIeijHyInz7E7FQvCA/edit#heading=h.164sp507m3e).      

- 'Forage' Django full-stack 'image board' app - built as a team of 3, again during the GA London intensive bootcamp. I'd already dabbled in Python before the course so it was great fun applying this into a project. Project repository available [here](https://github.com/hphilpotts/Forage-Project-3-General-Assembly-SEI-66).      

- 'Album Review App': an Express.js app - built as a pair using the Express framework linked to MongoDB as part of GA London's SEI course. This was my first collaborative project and was so much fun to build as a team. Repo for this project is [here](https://github.com/hphilpotts/Album-Review-App-Project-2-General-Assembly-SEI-66).      

- 'The Simpsons' themed 'Guess Who?' frontend web game - built solo as the first project of GA London's SEI bootcamp course. My very first project! [Here](https://github.com/hphilpotts/Simpsons-Guess-Who-Project-1-General-Assembly-SEI-66) is the link to the repo.
