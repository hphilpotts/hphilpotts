- 👋 Hi, I’m @hphilpotts. Officially a Henry but I'm usually known as Harry.   
- 👀 I’m interested in JavaScript first and foremost, especially as part of MERN stack web apps. Fullstack apps are my fave but I'm just as comfortable working on the front-end as on the back-end.     
- 🕵️‍♂️ _I'm also very interested in finding my first job in software development!_ 😅       
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about hosting different web apps now that Heroku has gone 'paid-only'. Been a blessing in disguise as I've learned a lot (not so much when it comes to AWS though).   
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything JS, React especially. Also any interesting Python/Django as I need an excuse to revisit them!    
- 📫 How to reach me: `hphilpotts@gmail.com`
