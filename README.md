# About    

- 👋 **Hi, I’m @hphilpotts**. Officially a Henry but I'm usually known as Harry.   
- 👀 **I’m interested in** JavaScript first and foremost, especially as part of MERN stack web apps. Fullstack apps are my fave but I'm just as comfortable working on the front-end as on the back-end.     
- 👉 ...I'm also very interested in finding my first job in software development! 🕵️‍♂️             
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning about** hosting different web apps now that Heroku has gone 'paid-only'. Been a blessing in disguise as I've learned a lot (_not so much when it comes to AWS though_). See [this repository](https://github.com/hphilpotts/Pokegotchi-Frontend-Project-4-General-Assembly-SEI-66-rehost) for my most recent and toughest lessons learned on finding decent free web app hosting. I'm also sharpening my JS skills - particularly DOM manipulation - and doing daily coding challenges to minimise skill atrophy during the long job search. Lastly, I'm [reading up on Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) as it turns out you can't just `array.sort()` your way out of everything...               
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on** anything JS, React especially. Also any interesting Python/Django as I need an excuse to revisit them!    
- 👨‍💻 **If I'm not coding** (or working, got bills to pay) I'll probably be cooking, cycling or at the pub. I'd like to say reading or running too but these happen...less often. Previously the list would include gaming but I'm on a self-imposed hiatus until I get that first job!
