# About    

- 👋 **Hi, I’m @hphilpotts**. Officially a Henry but I'm usually known as Harry.   
- 👀 **I’m interested in** JavaScript first and foremost, especially as part of MERN stack web apps, but I also love working in Python. Fullstack apps are my fave but I'm just as comfortable working on the front-end as on the back-end. I'm also learning TypeScript and am finding the differences with JS fascinating!         
- 👉 ...I'm also very interested in finding my first job in software development! 🕵️‍♂️             
- 🌱 **I’ve recently been learning about** hosting different web apps now that Heroku has gone 'paid-only'. Been a blessing in disguise as I've learned a lot, even when the learning curve has been steep at times! See [this repository](https://github.com/hphilpotts/Pokegotchi-Frontend-Project-4-General-Assembly-SEI-66-rehost) for my most recent and toughest lessons learned on finding decent free web app hosting. I'm also [reading up on Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) as it turns out you can't just `array.sort()` your way out of everything...           
- 👷‍♂️ **My current side-project** is very much a mini-one - a simple calculator using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. Not original, I know, but you can't say it's not a classic! It's been a great opportunity to revisit and rebuid some key skills I haven't used for a while.                     
- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on** anything JS, React especially. Also any interesting Python/Django as I need an excuse to revisit them!    
- 👨‍💻 **If I'm not coding** (or working, got bills to pay) I'll probably be cooking, cycling or at the pub. I'd like to say reading or running too but these happen...less often. Previously the list would include gaming but I'm on a self-imposed hiatus until I get that first job!
